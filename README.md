Operating Systems project - Editing Linux utilities

this project has 3 main utilities to develop:

**mkbkp** that allows user to create a compressed folder of a directory provided in function parameters.
**equals** that print if two objects (either files or folders) are exactly the same. If not, it provides a log of differences.
**plive** that shows the most CPU-bursting processes.
